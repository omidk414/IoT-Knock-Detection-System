# IoT_Knock_Sensor
using an Arduino MEGA2560 and percussion sensor
The main function is to listen for a high pitch volume such as a knock, that triggers a light to turn on indicating that the sensor picked up something. The program sends an email and text to my phone notifying me that the system has picked up on a high pitch sound. The inputs of the system is a knock sensor, the use of Python and micro LED lights, to test out the function. A cheap and simple alternative to other home security products such as Ring or nest door bells which notify the user of a presence. 
# Replicating
1. Clone the project and change the username, recipient and password.
2. Download the ino file using the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Ardunio MEGA.
3. Construct the project using the schematics shown below.

4. Attach the sensor to the door with any preferred method.
5. Run the pyDistancer.py on Windows 10.
6. Test the knock and view email to verify if the message is sent.
